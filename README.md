# MarIA_project
### Required python 3.7
Project that uses ChatGPT and Dall-E technologies to answer questions, follow a conversation and generate text-based 
images. To use it, you need to:

1) Create a bot for teleram using BotFather (https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial) and an openai 
account (https://openai.com/api/). Copy the tokens to a file inside the project called 
.env containing the structure: 
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN"
2) Create a virtual environment in python, install the libraries with pip install requirements.txt and then run 
$python main.py;
3) You can also run through $docker-compose up --build. You need to have docker compose installed and configured in your environment.

To test it in real time, send a message on Telegram to: @mmmarchetti_bot.
Answers to questions are generated by the tool. To generate images, make a request, such as: "draw an image of a dog sitting in front of a notebook programming a solution in python"
